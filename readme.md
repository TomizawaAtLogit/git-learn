    fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.  
    To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

        git push --set-upstream origin main

    To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking  
    upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

git push --set-upstream origin main

git checkout {commit number}  
    Note: switching to 'ec148a8'.

    You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
    changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
    state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

    If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
    do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

    git switch -c <new-branch-name>

    Or undo this operation with:

    git switch -

    Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

    HEAD is now at ec148a8 add articles on readme

git checkout main
